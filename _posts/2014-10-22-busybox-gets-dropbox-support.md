BusyBox 2.0 is available on the App Store, and with this new version you can now synchronize your activity data via Dropbox.

To get started, just hit the "Sync" button in the top right corner of the home screen.
Then login to Dropbox to enable synchronization.

This way you will not lose your activity data when getting a new device. Simply login to Dropbox from BusyBox to restore your old data.

Also in this new version, the exported .csv file now contains a new column that provides the duration in minutes, in addition to the start and end dates.
