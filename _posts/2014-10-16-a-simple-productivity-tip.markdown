Here is a simple productivity tip that can save you a lot of time.

If you start tracking whatever you do during your day using BusyBox, you may be surprised by the amount of time you are spending on some websites. Social media, I am looking at you.
For some people, it will be Facebook. For me, it was definitely Twitter. So first things first, get the BusyBox iPhone app and start tracking what you do.

Often, all these distractions can wait for your lunch break or the evening. So once you have identified the sources of distraction, block the websites. You can use the LeechBlock Firefox add-on, or the StayFocused extension for Chrome.
These will keep the distraction away by showing "site blocked" pages when you try to access a blocked website.

I love the message that StayFocused shows you when you block a website and change the default allowed time to 3 minutes:

*"You're giving yourself LESS time? slow clap. Well played my friend."*

Well played indeed!

Of course at the beginning, you will try to open Facebook in your browser just like you did before. But in no time you will have forged a new habit: not opening Facebook anymore while you are working.

If you have apps on your phone that send you some notifications, remove them. Or at least revoke them the right to spam you with notifications.

Keep in mind that every interruption is a productivity killer. Protect your work flow and stay focused!
